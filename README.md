## Description

This site uses Nextjs server side rendering during home page load with `getStaticServerProps`, it provides all posts and
parses users to those posts. Uses object transformation for `users` to normalize data for better usage.

Detail pages are generated using SSG, that means during build time.

Search is done by basic css and useContext, nothing fancy. Object are searched recursivly but also memoized based on search value.
